## FlatQuest

 Check out a game I made in a team by looking at FlatQuest/dist/FlatQuest.jar. 

Note that the music used for the game is by Dexter Britain and is under a cc license (check him out at www.dexterbritain.com).

## Poetry Projects

These projects meshes art and computer science.

In Ecopoetics, I create a GUI to navigate poetry I wrote in a college class. The overall experience requires an understanding of source code (i.e. poetry within the source code), and a constant back and forth between GUI and source code. THIS PROJECT INTENTIONALLY SACRIFICES DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTISTIC EXPERIENCE. See 'A house of nodes.py'.

In RandomPoetry, I make a poetry creator that works by taking pieces of old poetry and randomly producing new poetry. See 'Briefcase.py'.
