## General Info

I wrote the bulk of these projects in college (2017 - 2018). [FlatQuest](#FlatQuest)
was a culminating project for a software engineering course designed
to teach fundamental development practices. I GitHubbed and Scrummed for this project in a team with three other undergraduate
students. [Poetry Projects](#Poetry-projects) arose naturally as part of two poetry courses
I took (Ecopoetics and Advanced Poetry). While not required for the courses, I decided
spicing up poetry with computer science (and vice versa) would make everything more interesting.

## FlatQuest

Inspired by exacting professors and the desire to build a beautiful game, I collaborated in a
team of four undergraduate students to produce a quirky side scrolling platforming game.

The game follows Flatley, a square, as it progresses through various levels in FlatLand.
I won't spoil the story line here, but we drew a small bit of inspiration from Edwin Abbott's
book - Flatland, and Thomas Was Alone's narration style.

#### How to access the game

Navigate to the FlatQuest/dist folder and click on the FlatQuest.jar file. The file has been configured to run
as an executable so no need for programming IDE's!

#### Musical notes

The music used for the game is by Dexter Britain and is under a cc license (check him out at www.dexterbritain.com).

## Poetry Projects

Is writing code poetry or is poetry writing code? I think the answer is yes, but we sometimes end up ignoring this
idea. In these projects, I explore how coding aids and eventually becomes poetry.

### Ecopoetics

I create a GUI to navigate poetry I wrote in a college class.
The overall experience requires an understanding of source code (i.e. poetry within the source code), and a constant back and forth between GUI and source code. THIS PROJECT INTENTIONALLY SACRIFICES DESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE ARTISTIC EXPERIENCE. See 'A house of nodes.py'.

### RandomPoetry

In RandomPoetry, I make a poetry creator that works by taking pieces of old poetry and randomly producing new poetry. See 'Briefcase.py'.
