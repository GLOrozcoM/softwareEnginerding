I wonder if..
â€¦the cloud as I see it now

graph

once a while back was here. 

These clouds all raining free extra fixed
wasted new.

The place has a memory too. It sees the clouds gather.
It feels the roots underneath thirst for righteousness. It
feels the brush of the river on bank and benthic samples. It 
smells the leaves rustling and it

	Remembers to 
	rain.

Some places remember better than others.
