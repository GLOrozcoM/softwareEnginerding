What a bloody pen. 
W/ it, the mayor drafted a petition to 

“make a highway through to someone else’s opportunity.”

It leaves dark red scribing on malleable parchment. 

- - Picks up the pen. - -
- - Dips it in the pockets of the bank accounts of the corrupt. - -

And now they write w/ pens loaded w/ the frowns of 
the smiles they bought and the maroon.
