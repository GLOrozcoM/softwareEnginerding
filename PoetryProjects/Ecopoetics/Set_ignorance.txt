Let f be a function that maps everything I don’t know to everything I could know about here. 

Set I of ignorance. 

Set K of knowledge. 

Then, |K| \geq |L|. And equality is only achieved when the galaxies like grains of sand sink in 
Mort’s hourglass.

Therefore, all move from a place of ignorance to another place of ignorance, 
surrounded by a swarm of unknowns.

Graph of unknowns. 

which can only be searched through a bridge of time, but 

the bridge of time has no end.
