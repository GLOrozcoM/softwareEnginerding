The leg music of a cricket 

	Squirrel swirl

A bird pizzicato

	Non-syncopated ( 0 ) cry

A non-diesel car driving away

	The leaves will swell
		and
	cluster w/ an algorithmic current

(I can still taste the scone. )

Decentralizing is wicked hard man! 
After all, we are the centers of our perception, and if we claim to not
be Copernicus’ sun, then we are arguing on the power of imagination. 
That is probably true.

Isn’t it absolutely laughable to say that this is my spot?
