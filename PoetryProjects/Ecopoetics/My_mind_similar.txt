Ways my mind is similar to here:

	1.	A background stream of consciousness continues its insectual rhythm, even if I don’t see it/hear it/smell it/taste it/touch it/grok it. 
	2.	The fauna of thoughts is diverse. But a lot of it is green.
	3.	Flux is the only constant. 
	4.	I don’t understand it.
	5.	I’m not sure if its beautiful. 

BUT THEY’RE STILL NOT THE SAME.
