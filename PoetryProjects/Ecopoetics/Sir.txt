I am still looking for the right questions.
But I see they’re actually left. 

I gave up. My body has 100% giving up rate. 
It will not continue once my sands of time sink. 

and the more I flail, 

the more I sink. (idea, implement sinking word)

Like Hermione’s plants. 

I…
This, my memory gun has run out of bullets. 
I must use seeds instead. 

I’ll point them at myself and pull.

BANG. BANG.

and a flowing function of \rr rivers of Trees will erupt. 
Like a flowing new type. A new object new flower of verse..

Where a catharsis of pens gently weeps. 

I do want to grow up to be like you.

A sort of wry deathly humor is needed. 

A joyous attention. 
A sort of wicked awareness.

and a standing under the cold waterfall of curiosity. 

There is no armor like the Honest wears. 
It’s so barren though. 

Or maybe it’s all a myth sir. 

But then why is this an apology? B/c my words like
lame cripples fall out of my upside down stream of consciousness and 
they weren’t the droids you asked for. 

Instead a circuitous fox. Like Snyder suggests. Sets my traps for me. 
Into which I fall. 

Who is the fox? Where are the traps? 
How do I

Become a beginner again? 

By drowning in this and that 
cesspool of poetry…?
