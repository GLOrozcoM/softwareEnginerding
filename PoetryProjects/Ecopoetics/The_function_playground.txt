I came here today, and there was a sign posted/placed on the tires saying:

 
From 
the
River
to
Reuse

info
―570-523-0114―

How is retirement looking for the tires?

We can make three different cycles:

(570)(523)(0114)

		- No repetition allowed
		(014)

Let alpha be the permutation 	      b/c
described by these cycles. 	     1-> 1
Then					             1 -> 4

alpha = (1 2 3 4 5 6)  		 but it should be a function so 
	    4 3 7 5 2 6		         each input should have a unique output. 
	    7 0 )
              0  1

I saw that amazing pool of function with its cycle eddies. On the playground:

What would happen if x said hi to a?
