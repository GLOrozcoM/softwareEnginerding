Cabeza ensangrentada,
herida for mi bien. 
*The taste of grapes*
*The slow moving stanza*

I came to hid and you discovered/disrobed me. 

I came to learn and walked out a fool. 

I came to listen and ran away screaming a deaf ladâ€™s cry.

I came to die and you showed no mercy.

I came for a ghost in your haunted 
house
	only to find a 
			cadaver. 

I came to not come,
and
I heard the sound of one hand clapping.
