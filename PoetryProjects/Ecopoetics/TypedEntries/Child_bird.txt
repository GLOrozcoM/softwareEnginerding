When I was just a little boy, I was walking around
the dirt in my backyard, and I saw a bird, dead. I wanted to 
touch it, but my mom said, 

	“NO!”

Birds are the flying zoos of the air.

And since ten I don’t see a bird but a 

	writing mass of small maggots. 

	It must be a warm farm of microbes. 

	To be enveloped by them,
	and lost. 

But I didn’t kill it! 
Half closed yes, it had.
