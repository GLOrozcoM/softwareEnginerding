“The octopi of time 
all oozing and tentacling
up the river Susquehanna

ready to choke you

to blind you w/ their precious ink

to wrap you in a cold and sling embrace

	and…

	…HOP OFF YOU AND SMILE :)!
	IT WAS ALL A JOKE!”

Now they all walk/tentacle backwards back in the Susquehanna

Back in the kingdom (queendom?)
of deep time.

Calligramme. 

- - That cricket must have legs o’ iron

	cuz 

it’s still going’. - - 

I wonder if..
…the cloud as I see it now

graph

once a while back was here. 

These clouds all raining free extra fixed
wasted new.

The place has a memory too. It sees the clouds gather.
It feels the roots underneath thirst for righteousness. It
feels the brush of the river on bank and benthic samples. It 
smells the leaves rustling and it

	Remembers to 
	rain.

Some places remember better than others.
