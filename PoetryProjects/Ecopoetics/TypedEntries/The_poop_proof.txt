Claim: Throw poop on the wall a lot and some of it will stick.

Proof: By definition, poop is sticky. 
Also, walls are adhesive surfaces. Whenever an x \in poop comes into contact
w/ a wall, another x_{-1} \in wall bonds w/ x. Together, we have that 

Graph. 

so:

xx_{-1} = s where s \in $ and $ is the sticky group. Since every s \in $
is sticky we know some poop will stick. Hence, some poop will stick on the wall
if you throw it (as desired). QED
