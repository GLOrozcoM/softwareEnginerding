Fellow humans from the land of Super Saturday are playing that game w/ a small 
trampoline and a small ball.

And the ball is actually a poem they’re bouncing.

What would the poem-ball look like?

- Not a crumpled ball of paper.
- It’s more of a Susquehanna river of slow moving tar.

They bounce this ball on this green hill to my right.

Where they know not what the ball is made of.

And where a 100 years before, a group of sophomores did the same. 

Only w/o a small trampoline. 

“I only drank one beer dude.”

Think of a thousand splendid metallic silver scales all moving as a current. They sound
loud. 千鳥見たい。千のとり。Each scale the voice of one who saw the river.

- - It is merely a way to count how many.  - -

A big pipe leads to the river. You can’t see it unless you face the way you came. Follow
the pipe, and it will you to a small pool underneath a road vent. Look up. You’ll see a small 
curious kitten poking its upper torso thru the vent. You’ll hear pounding and panting and then 
see an Aztec bend over the kitten. The Aztec says, 

	“Come.”

And tries to pick up the kitten up. But as the Aztec’s finger brushes the back of the kitten,
the whole body slips thru the vent and plops into you (the water). 
The Aztec cries, 

	“No! No!”

…and continues the run.
