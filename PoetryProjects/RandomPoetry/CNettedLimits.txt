The Extra Hand 

Comments: 

I originally thought that “clouds of netted limits…” would refer to the two short episodes: the store, and the basketball court (they were sad clouds following the speaker around). I am guilty as charged. I agree that the line needed to work in some other way. I chose to eject it since I found I did not want to pursue the episode like form further. 

Molasses also ejected itself. Mostly because I did not want to deal with the cliche. But also because I felt that the first part of the poem was indeed the poem. I just needed to determine how it should end. I suppose that the subjects rising to meet the speaker could have worked, but not here.

I see this poem functioning as a reflection on childhood and its relation to the current feeling of inadequacy that the speaker has. This is present in “lettered in platinum without my mind written in it”. So, I felt there had to be a way for the speaker to come to terms with it (terms-inate it?). The Biblical reference seems like it might work with the roll, and “it” being an angel of death (the extra hand) seems to work well. I feel less good about attacking the management majors, but we don’t need to tell them.
