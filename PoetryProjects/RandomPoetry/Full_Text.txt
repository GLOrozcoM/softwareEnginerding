A blank page tried to eat me once. It had big white teeth like a great white shark, and it smelled my blood. It’s eyes were like two ships, and it a carried a (n, k) number of maybes. 

Maybe	Maybe	Maybe	Maybe.

The cycles for maybe
(m -> a -> y -> b -> e)

The inverse
(e b y a m)

The machine in whole:

(a b y m)
 b y a a

But you see maybe is so much more. 
We wish it to wed Yes and divorce No. We sometimes love Maybe more than Is. It is too now. Too much hereness to be digestible.

I feel cold. Like a bullet at my heart. It would warm inside my chest. Only the bullet part would be freezing. 


Last time I was here, I remembered G.C.’s story about a bear in Lewisburg. I though on people running around like headless chickens. I looked up and
the
		bear was there. 

It was looking at me from the bottom of the little hill. I was sure it was an illusion, but one can’t be sure (two, maybe). I looked at it a while longer then
decided to move to a bench. Lying on gravel is uncomfortable man (or woman? or something else?). So I walked towards the bear, but it didn’t move. 
I got closer and before my very eyes the bear

	turned into a pile of tires. 

―

I came here today, and there was a sign posted/placed on the tires saying:

 
From 
the
River
to
Reuse

info
―570-523-0114―

How is retirement looking for the tires?

We can make three different cycles:

(570)(523)(0114)

		- No repetition allowed
		(014)

Let alpha be the permutation 	b/c
described by these cycles. 	1-> 1
Then					1 -> 4

alpha = (1 2 3 4 5 6)  		bit it should be a function so 
	    4 3 7 5 2 6		each input should have a unique output. 
	    7 0 )
              0  1

I saw that amazing pool of function with its cycle eddies. On the playground:

Remember the tires? They’re gone now. Their sign is also gone. 

As I write, a number of tubers are being carried by the Susquehanna. A bird is screaming or squawking or doing its thing, but I don’t know which type of bird it is. I am not very knowledgeable about birds…

Sometimes I remember to offer my attention to the noises in the background, and I can hear a continuous insectual percussion reverie. 
From this vantage point, there are silver mirror on the river that remind me of the impressionists. They wanted/believed? light was important. 

A couple just drove up. They’re smoking. 
I’m guessing they just went out to eat. 
Dessert is smoke. 

Murph fulfilled the polar plunge here. I think he got tired after waiting so long. Imagine limping forever. 

―The car with the couple just pulled away―

――

Ways my mind is similar to here:

	1.	A background stream of consciousness continues its insectual rhythm, even if I don’t see it/hear it/smell it/taste it/touch it/grok it. 
	2.	The fauna of thoughts is diverse. But a lot of it is green.
	3.	Flux is the only constant. 
	4.	I don’t understand it.
	5.	I’m not sure if its beautiful.

Claim: Throw poop on the wall a lot and some of it will stick.

Proof: By definition, poop is sticky. 
Also, walls are adhesive surfaces. Whenever an x \in poop comes into contact
w/ a wall, another x_{-1} \in wall bonds w/ x. Together, we have that 

Graph. 

so:

xx_{-1} = s where s \in $ and $ is the sticky group. Since every s \in $
is sticky we know some poop will stick. Hence, some poop will stick on the wall
if you throw it (as desired). QED

Fellow humans from the land of Super Saturday are playing that game w/ a small

And the ball is actually a poem they’re bouncing.

What would the poem-ball look like?

- Not a crumpled ball of paper.
- It’s more of a Susquehanna river of slow moving tar.

They bounce this ball on this green hill to my right.

Where they know not what the ball is made of.

And where a 100 years before, a group of sophomores did the same. 

Only w/o a small trampoline.

A big pipe leads to the river. You can’t see it unless you face the way you came. Follow
the pipe, and it will you to a small pool underneath a road vent. Look up. You’ll see a small 
curious kitten poking its upper torso thru the vent. You’ll hear pounding and panting and then 
see an Aztec bend over the kitten. The Aztec says, 

	“Come.”

And tries to pick up the kitten up. But as the Aztec’s finger brushes the back of the kitten,
the whole body slips thru the vent and plops into you (the water). 
The Aztec cries, 

	“No! No!”

…and continues the run.

“She just talks and talks. I think she thinks her mouth is good for something other than my cock. The foolery!”
