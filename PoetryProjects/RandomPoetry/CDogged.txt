Ikari 

Comments: 

While the stream of consciousness was interesting to me, after giving this poem time, the only part that I felt happy to keep was the explicit anger component. I think that this part was what I had tried writing my way into (for that is indeed what I was doing). 

I do not want to add or remove because it feels complete. I only modified “the subconscious clause” part because I realized the original sounded cool, but did not communicate the intention behind the poem, which I feel, has to do with the speaker’s frustration at being forced to do something with the anger. 


Ikari is, of course, anger in Japanese.
