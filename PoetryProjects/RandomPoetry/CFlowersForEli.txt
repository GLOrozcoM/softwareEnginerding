Flowers for Eli 

Comments: 

Perhaps the reference is long lost, but I hoped in the title and in the body concerning an obsession with intelligence to evoke Flowers For Algernon. But even if that evocation is lost, I am not concerned. I was concerned, however, that you did not securely see the purple haired dog at all. How could you not? It’s after all, a dog with purple hair. So, I played with keeping it in there since I did see it (vividly), but decided to destroy it in favor of adding something at the end. To be fair, I had intentionally used the dog as an attempt to embrace your challenge in class that, “What would it be like to write a poem about purple and therapy dogs?” So, I saw the first stanza performing its generative qualities for the poem and them leaving. You’ll of course notice that the purple haired dog stays in the poem (it has to!).  

Your suggestion to extend I took cautiously since in this poem I was trying intentionally to be short. Call it a mimicry attempt of Mallory and Troy. It was also hard since I saw it as a strong ending for Eli to always enjoy eating that strawberry. My revision does change to give Eli (or the viewer of Eli) a bleaker look on life. I was OK with this since happy endings can be ever so depressing. 

Preemptively, I note what could be a turn off: my allusion to a “revision”. I explain it by noting that this is meant to be absurd, and I do find revisioning absurd (we may talk at length about this after everything is over).
