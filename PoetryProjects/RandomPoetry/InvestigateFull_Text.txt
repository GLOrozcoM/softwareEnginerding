“She’s so basic it makes my bitches look bad.”

“Do you think she’d look good on my bed?”

“Why they just don’t open up a sluthouse is beyond me.”

“I totally did not go down on her after she went down on me.”

I do not want to add or remove because it feels complete. I only modified “the subconscious clause” part because I realized the original sounded cool, but did not communicate the intention behind the poem, which I feel, has to do with the speaker’s frustration at being forced to do something with the anger. 
“She just talks and talks. I think she thinks her mouth is good for something other than my cock. The foolery!”

“They tried to tell me it was rape. That would presuppose that women aren’t my playthings.”

I like it when my mouth is exposed. 
Because then my inner jelly can be cannalled right out. 

I cannot speak unless my mouth is covered. And only when my eyes are closed can you hear what I say.
