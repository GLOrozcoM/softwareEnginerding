Forgiveness please -  a way to make amends for easy ignorance, stunted ambition. 
As far as my initial claim goes, the territory that it opens, I wanted to agree with you. Certainly, only the bottommost beatitudes seemed to relate to the first with its claim about rest. And, as a reader jumping into the middle (e.g. spit and death mirages), there really is no backwards connection.


The poem is exciting for me because of the implication and chaining that occurs. Moreover (what a ghastly word, but I have to use it all the time in proof writing), part of the intrigue is that these links work towards a new water not previously tasted concerning beatitudes (I take your words on speculation reflect this intrigue).  
 However, that kernel remains strong for me as merely that — a kernel (a starting point for the next link). Yes, the Sabbath is a blessed day because of the speakers soul finding no rest. So, we examine that claim by speaking of the blessing it contains (it forces the speaker to wonder about beauty). And so forth. This is merely a direct link between the previous and the forward link (much like a doubly linked list…). So, each link is a kernel for the next.

But at least I have good posture. And my clothes fit me today.
