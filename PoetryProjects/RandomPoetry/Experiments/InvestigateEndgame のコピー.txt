Although I feel it is complete, I am certain I could extend this into a large-ish suite. But, I don’t want to open that lovely can of peaches yet. Extending this might be the work of my next life since I still place a mask (*gasp*) on my anger.

I do not want to add or remove because it feels complete. I modified the subconscious clausepart because I realized the original sounded cool, but did not communicate the intention behindthe poem, which I feel, has to do with the speaker’s frustration at being forced to do something with the anger.
