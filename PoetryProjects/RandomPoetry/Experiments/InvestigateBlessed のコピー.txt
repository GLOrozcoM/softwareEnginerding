The only direct connection to the Sabbath lies between the first two lines, in the ante-penultimate, and the last lines. Every other claim made is only linked via the others, and I only cared about the Sabbath as the first link to start at (consider it the middle of this chain where the reader should jump in). I did want to give this a circular form, thus a feint towards an ending in the ante-penultimate line, and the final line to go to the sabbath. 
Shabbos

 However, that kernel remains strong for me as merely that — a kernel (a starting point for the next link). Yes, the Sabbath is a blessed day because of the speakers soul finding no rest. So, we examine that claim by speaking of the blessing it contains (it forces the speaker to wonder about beauty). And so forth. This is merely a direct link between the previous and the forward link (much like a doubly linked list…). So, each link is a kernel for the next. 
So I would argue against viewing the motions as subsidiary and seeing them instead as direct consequences of previous motions. In maths terms, I would distinguish this by saying I intentionally do not want transitivity to happen across the links (for then death, mirages, spit, and Sabbath are together, but I do not want that). I am willing to give that transitivity may be imputed without my consent. In which case, I lose, you win.

No satisfaction to your desire for companion poems will exist soon. I do note your point about the title, and I have switched to the tame “Shabbos”. I see now that my original title referred to something no one has any way of knowing (Chains from Locke Lamora’s universe of thieves), and no true connection (I just liked the word “canticle”). I also switched the blonde to blond, even though I love the e (much like Anne spelled with an e).

But since this poem I write for myself (and secondarily for you), I intend to hug it a little longer before I let go. Guinea will see to it.
