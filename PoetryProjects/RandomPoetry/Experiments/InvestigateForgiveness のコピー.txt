The only direct connection to the Sabbath lies between the first two lines, in the ante-penultimate, and the last lines. Every other claim made is only linked via the others, and I only cared about the Sabbath as the first link to start at (consider it the middle of this chain where the reader should jump in). I did want to give this a circular form, thus a feint towards an ending in the ante-penultimate line, and the final line to go to the sabbath. 
As far as my initial claim goes, the territory that it opens, I initially wanted to agree with you. Certainly, only the bottommost beatitudes seemed to relate to the first with its claim about rest. And, as a reader jumping into the middle (e.g. spit and death mirages), there really is no backwards connection.

But at least I have good posture. And my clothes fit me today.
