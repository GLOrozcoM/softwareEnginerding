I love your label of this is a weak effort. It’s lovely since I spent more time 
designing this one than many of the others. This reaffirms my believe that
volume spent on a task will not necessarily mean quality. 

Unlike the beatitude poem, I will avoid defending this one. In fact, 
I do not see myself coming back to this unless I am suffering from a
horrific spell of writer’s block, and I need to latch onto something. 
I will drop this in the river and let it float away. 

It doesn’t excite me at all to revise it. 
I thrust my hand into the  Carribbean the questions ice-ish cold-ish slither around my eye
                  eye                fear                      fishes					     hand

when they get used to the comfort of the warm   eye     amongst them the hand closes.

I pull my eye   out, within it, a question shivers. Its hands plead to me. I pull out a hook  
	   hand                            fish 		     eyes
from the tackle box. The hook pierces the fish, and blue   blood     flows down my eye  .

I gently lower the dying    fish 	into the fear .             Curious    questions slowly   fade     towards

the dying spectacle. Here and there, the    fishes    skewer themselves upon the hook. The blood

begins to smoke in the verbs.

The sharks will smell it.
