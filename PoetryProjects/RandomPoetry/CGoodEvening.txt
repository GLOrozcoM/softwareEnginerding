Good Evening! 

Comments: 

I took your suggestion for 5 or 6 poems more to heart. These are those 5. 
They are a quintet, and somehow Good Evening! lives with them as a 
party crasher. Besides being ridiculous, I also attempted a strict at the end 
of each one. I think this brings them much closer together as a family.
