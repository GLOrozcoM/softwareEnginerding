Good Evening! Poem 

Good Evening! 

Levantine: Oh’s didn’t save David from Bathsheeba. Besides, it’s in your name. 
Good evening, Hope! 

Oh what a time to be alive!

Good evening, oh quad, now of Malesardi nomenclature! 
Good evening, lights of mourning! 
Functor: What? 
Oh what vivid vivacious vociferous venal virtue
oh Venice it is!
That is when I see that amazing pool of function and all its cycle eddies. 
[Feistel breaks out of his cycle eddies pooling in the mind]

Oh what a grand time indeed! 
Levantine: Right now, they do me. 
Wait. Why does it smell like red? 

Bathroom Scene Poem 


Levantine: I ran out of my Felix’s ages ago ‘Tor. Besides, it is a viable question, who was worse? Engage me. 
Argentina: Well. Levantine is nice. His calling you is nice. It』s all so damn nice, Functor.   
Functor: Old line. 
Functor: I see what you mean. 
	Untrustworthy ant things start troooping towards me out of the marble sink. 「Bad math」, I would call this (or the opposite of Lithium Flower』s theme). Although each regales difference, they march to a single tempo. 
Functor: Dibs on Chaplin.
Functor: Who are you? 

- Humble brags (these troop as an entente with two too many trumpets)

- The desire for green eyes. 
- These performances people put on that are bad because they are either fake (in which case, they』re untrustworthy by essence) or they are not fake (but oh they feel fake) in which case they are untrustworthy by virtue of stupidity. 
Functor: I’m already getting married. 


If I eat it, it won』t die since its broken down vectors will still look for directions in my stomach. Whirlpools of lice growing in there.  
[One wonders how Levantine manages to speak without the umlauts.]
So I stare into it looking for the corpus of truth -
Functor: What is your name? 
Antennae waiting and brushing my shoulder -
humming Iko Iko while Feistel lounges on the couch thinking.]

Netted Limits Poem 1

Clouds of netted limits followed me around that day. I walked into the little store, sat on the bench and rested. Who should come in but the mechanic with the extra hand - made of metal and combustion. 

- The desire for green eyes. 
[jump to [In a wooden room] ]- The 「How are you?」question that doesn’t expect an answer. 

[In a wooden room, play]
till they roll up 





slothing 
They promised me a fair match, but every time I took the ball my legs turned to molasses. 
[In a bathroom, play]
I refused waters of refreshment from my tomodachi to try to play. 

I did not go quietly into the night.

Flowers for Eli Poem 


[Argentina mixes apathy with disgust. It’s like cake with too much baking soda.]




5 to 1 baby, 

Levantine: Fine. Maa-salaameh then to this thin rabbit of a trail? 


[Functor smirks a tech-tonical smile. Functor knows that Levantine operates from a position of self-fulfilling prophecy. Hence, the reluctance to engage in a lost argument.]
Levantine: Right now, they do me. 


[Functor smiles because she used the word unorthodox]

Berkeley’s Ecolunch Poem 

Functor: “Your grandma and my grandma, sitting by the fire” I think that fire would lose its heat if both our grandma’s were there. 
I sat at a table feeling the frequencies in the silverware 
and the glasnost pulsing in the voice from the podium. 
He spoke of the school for the restivus (like ‘fest of us’) 
and how independence is the diamond we should smelt in our 
own metamorphic minds (like the mines from House Atreides). 

His watch glinted, and the air of the room exited 
[IT PERFORMED “EXIT”]. I remembered that I was bored so 
I looked up to see where the air went. No one was moving. 
One crumpet/bean/bloke/fella had a crumpet in between his teeth. 
Feistel: - this container has to take what you just sang, and make it safely to the station. 
or the conveyor of the stillness. 

My own watch observed me, and I felt its face’s forgiveness. 

And just like that, the speaker spoke again, people plopped, and I could
hear in the background Bach’s Prelude and Fugue in C# Major. 
I realized I wanted to be a victim of sparse density.   

Functor: Meine name ist, indeed. 

Let # = my_field_of_fucks 

Show me the dimension of (#).
Functor: “Your grandma and my grandma, sitting by the fire” I think that fire would lose its heat if both our grandma’s were there.

          insert experience into #.   
   }
Levantine: In truth, Functor, you shall not surely die. 

                   run.deamon() 
Functor: I’m inclined to answer, but Levantine is calling me. 
Show me the dimension of (#)

Ok fine.

Funerals are for the living anyway.
