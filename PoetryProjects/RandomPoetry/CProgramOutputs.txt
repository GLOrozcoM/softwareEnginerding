Program Outputs

Comments: 

I am including these as revisions to something. Maybe all of the body of work? 
I think they both represent something done this semester. 

In InvestigateFlowersForEli.txt, I am merely reproducing the raw output of the program. But I
chose it because it seemed to me to have collated elements I tried to move away 
from CS, and inevitably coming back to. I also loved the juxtaposition of //maybe itâ€™s
the deamon? 

In Anger vaults, I ejected and inserted parts of an original output. You will note 
what may seem like a type in the word nothing. That is intentional. It comes about when 
switching between docx and txt files, and when I saw it I thought THIS CAN TALK ABOUT
FORM. And maybe it does sort itself out regardless.
