The Extra Hand 

I walked into the little store, sat on the bench and rested. Who should come in but the mechanic with the extra hand, made of metal and combustion. 
The store became silent as the mechanic Spanished the lady behind the counter with Te mueves, y te quiebro las piernas. 
I lived in the periphery of his vision, my nation of childhood granting me diplomatic immunity. He Spanished the Coke loader Se que tienes mas cabron. 
The mechanic took what he could and walked out. I ghosted outside and saw the mechanic negotiating empty wallets for unfulfilled threats. 

I grew and saw that extra hand become a rolled scroll - lettered in platinum without my mind written in it. 

I laugh now because platinum in that form is useless. Even management majors know that. 

Just as the metal hand passed over me so shall the roll pass over me. 
It will see the blood and pass.
