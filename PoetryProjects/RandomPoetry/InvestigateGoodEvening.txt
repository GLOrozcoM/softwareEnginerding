Good Evening! 

Levantine: Oh’s didn’t save David from Bathsheeba. Besides, it’s in your name. 
Good evening, Hope! 

Oh what a time to be alive!

Good evening, oh quad, now of Malesardi nomenclature! 
Good evening, lights of mourning! 
Functor: What? 
Oh what vivid vivacious vociferous venal virtue
oh Venice it is!
That is when I see that amazing pool of function and all its cycle eddies. 
[Feistel breaks out of his cycle eddies pooling in the mind]

Oh what a grand time indeed! 
Levantine: Right now, they do me. 
Wait. Why does it smell like red?
