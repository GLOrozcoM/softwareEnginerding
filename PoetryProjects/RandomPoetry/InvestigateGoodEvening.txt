As a side note, I am curious as to what would have happened if we had gone with a different poem as my opener. Would I still have been graced with the label of a computer sciencey poet? 
Good evening, Hope!

Oh what vivid vivacious vociferous venal virtue
oh Venice it is!



Oh what a grand time indeed! 

Wait. Why does it smell like red?
