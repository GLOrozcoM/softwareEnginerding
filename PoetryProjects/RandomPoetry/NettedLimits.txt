Clouds of netted limits followed me around that day. I walked into the little store, sat on the bench and rested. Who should come in but the mechanic with the extra hand - made of metal and combustion. 
The store became silent as the mechanic Spanished the lady behind the counter with  Te mueves, y te quiebro las piernas. 
I lived in the periphery of his vision - my nation of childhood granting me diplomatic immunity. He Spanished the Coke loader Se que tienes mas cabron. 
The mechanic took what he could and walked out. I ghosted
outside and saw the Mechanic negotiating empty wallets for unfulfilled threats. 

	I grew up and saw that extra hand become a rolled scroll - lettered in platinum without my mind written in it.

	I used to play basketball confident that I would win every time. This is because I read books - not books about basketball, but about anything. 
Reading books told me that the people I played were always going to turn blindness to the gods - they stood in the null spaces telling me how to move. 

	I walked onto the court recently. Rising to meet me were Modern Algebra, Linear Algebra, Logic Sets and Proofs, Calculus 2, and Topology. 
They promised me a fair match, but every time I took the ball my legs turned to molasses. 
I felt the burnt stare of the gods in the null space, but they did not speak to me. 
I refused waters of refreshment from my tomodachi to try to play. 

I did not go quietly into the night.
