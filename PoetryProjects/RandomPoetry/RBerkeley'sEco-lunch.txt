Berkeley’s Eco-lunch 

I sat at a table feeling the frequencies in the silverware 
and the glasnost pulsing in the voice from the podium. 
He spoke of the school for the restivus (like ‘fest of us’) 
and how independence is the diamond we should smelt in our 
own metamorphic minds (like the mines from House Atreides). 

His watch glinted, and the air of the room exited 
[IT PERFORMED “EXIT”]. I remembered that I was bored so 
I looked up to see where the air went. No one was moving. 
One crumpet/bean/bloke/fella had a crumpet in between his teeth. 
The glint in the watch remained so I wondered if it was the minamoto 
or the conveyor of the stillness. 

My own watch observed me, and I felt its face’s forgiveness. 

And just like that, the speaker spoke again, people plopped, and I could
hear in the background Bach’s Prelude and Fugue in C# Major. 
I realized I wanted to be a victim of sparse density.
