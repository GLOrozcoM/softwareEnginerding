Scenes after dark

Comments: 

I destroyed the privilige and whiteness because this poem is not about race. I also replaced the regaling problem with something else (more Japanese!). A lit city was meant to be a revision to this as a sort of poem in a play. But A Lit City became its own body of work. And, I knew I wanted to explore one more scene here. 

In particular, I wanted a loop, and I wanted more Japanese. Thus, Scene 2. These are definitely sibling poems, and I believe they refer to the same universe of loops. 

So, your suggestion about a play only flew indirectly into A Lit City. “Play” here still means pressing the play button on this loop. I suspect that by having two of them together this “Play” will stand out further. If not, then I still think we can play with loops.
