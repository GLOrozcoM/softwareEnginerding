[In a bathroom, play]


	The freckled face white with privilege glares back at me. If I raise my nose up just this much (imagine dad saying 「this much」 with his explanatory child voice), I look like a pig. Damned pink things. Ignorance is easy for them. 

	Untrustworthy ant things start troooping towards me out of the marble sink. 「Bad math」, I would call this (or the opposite of Lithium Flower』s theme). Although each regales difference, they march to a single tempo. 

- The 「How are you?」question that doesn』t expect an answer. 
- My sister in law』s fucking buck teeth. 
- Humble brags (these troop as an entente with two too many trumpets)
- Classmate coitus fantasies that I know won』t go anywhere because in mid-fant-act I wonder if it means anything, and since I don』t want to have to impute the meaning, I force myself to forget it. 
- The desire for green eyes. 
- These performances people put on that are bad because they are either fake (in which case, they』re untrustworthy by essence) or they are not fake (but oh they feel fake) in which case they are untrustworthy by virtue of stupidity. 

I see some of the other ants go by, now roaches with feelers, and I don』t give any more -sighs- to them. My finger extends itself to them interrupting their sink march, and its (that one) hexadecimal movement presses my arm skin as it climbs up. 

If I eat it, it won』t die since its broken down vectors will still look for directions in my stomach. Whirlpools of lice growing in there.  

So I stare into it looking for the corpus of truth -
Bulbous bi-objects observing me -
Antennae waiting and brushing my shoulder -
Keep staring -
