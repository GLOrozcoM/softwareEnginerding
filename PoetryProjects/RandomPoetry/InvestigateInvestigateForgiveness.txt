I thrust my hand into the  Carribbean the questions ice-ish cold-ish slither around my eye
from the tackle box. The hook pierces the fish, and blue   blood     flows down my eye  .   

			     fear
			     Carribbean  

when they get used to the comfort of the warm   eye     amongst them the hand closes.  
The sharks will smell it.
