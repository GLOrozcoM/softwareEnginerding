Levantine: We』re going out tonight. 
Levantine: In truth, Functor, you shall not surely die. 

Argentina: Maybe not rude, but surely unorthodox. 



Functor: Verily verily say unto me, ‘Tel. 


[Functor smiles because she used the word unorthodox]

Functor: I think you could do better than old lines. 








Argentina: A friend of Levantine’s.
