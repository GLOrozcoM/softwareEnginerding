My Cell 

They are like rolls of toilet paper, only thicker. Wardens wet the rolls. 
Methodically, the wardens wrap me in the rolls. Now, we wait for Itami’s arrival, and in between hypo and hyper oxygenation, 

I break lakeless end ->   

hypo - 

	Remember:  
	
		   - the numbness in your nose and mouth when the fat one 
           		one threw the red leather at your face and you smelled 
	     		asphalt-dirt-mengambrea while the puddles in your mind 
	     		screamed 
         	  	  -  that 68% in your first year smoked your capillaries, 
           		and the 51/60  only a few days ago, and honor’s countenance 
           		shone upon  thy friends, but upon you:  

								     - silence from　
							             砂漠の神々

	Forget: 

	    	    - the A* that Newport and Dartmouth forged and you did 
			find in art’s maw 
          	    	    - the 丸　and バツ on the pink slip you carry in your wallet now 
          	   	    - your named frequencies are read and they do not stop cheering 
          	    	    - that moment when you began to see like Asher, the discrete 
                            meanings in smooth forms: 

							- 質問は何より’s warm embrace 
							- asymmetry 	


hyper - 

	Flow: 
		 - slow motion runs where the smiles contour me 
		 - 「I find the beauty beastly」 
                       - Realising that reading people should not be a phrase you utter
		 
      Gravity: 
		  - Sense of smell 
                        - Sounds of sense 

The pushing and pulling of the bands resides. Wardens carefully unravel me. I can listen now to the slosh of the mop outside.
I think of being a tile and how it would refresh me to be mopped.
