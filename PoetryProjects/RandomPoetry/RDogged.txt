How would one plot a feelings bank? 
Where I place my anger so it gathers interest wondering if it will be invested
away before I can withdraw. I imagine dark bullet vests protect the bank
from swine. Friend wants a free pass to see the vault because thatâ€™s a measure of
how we relate. But the inner constitution needs to make a joint clause where my 
subconscious does not need to sign on the dotted line. A black box might be a
safer place to hide the anger. Or a black box which they tell me Math can open.
