Endgame


Comments: 

I am changing nothing here. Besides the typo you pointed out, everything 
remains untransformed (sorry Linear Transformers, not today). 

As a side note, I am curious as to what would have happened if we had gone with a different poem as my opener. Would I still have been graced with the label of a computer sciencey poet?
