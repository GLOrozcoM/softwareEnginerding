My Cell

Comments: 

I saw the body of the poem as existing in a liminal space created by 
the water drowning imagery. I thought about manipulating the language and 
keeping the frame of being under water. Those thoughts went no where. So, instead,
I decided to reframe this as a happening during a kind of torture session involving 
wet bands (so I guess we still have the water). I feel better about this version since 
I use less clicheâ€™s (I hope), and it felt nice to think about the repose in being mopped.
