Flowers for Eli

An obsession with intelligence had left Eli feeling stupid.
Hence, he carried a rock so that he could wrap his hand around it.
He liked to pretend that the rock held his insecurity. Wrapping his hand around it offered physical comfort to a serious mental affliction. Except when he imagined himself as the rock and the hand as the intelligence of others. Then, numbness played its tune on his emotional accordion.

To forget those harmonics, Eli remembers the lady walking the purple
dog with her arms at right angles and how utterly splendid the whole
scene looked. Just like that time when the chicken had to duck because
the owl mistook the chicken’s head for a mouse. Or when the functions
yawned at him promising him their outputs. Or when he fell up to
pick that strawberry, caught between crocodiles and a Mongolian army.

- The strawberry always tasted good to Eli - 

The strawberry would shake Eli forcing him to revision the Mongolian army as a field 
composed of genderless faces. Crocodiles then, now, turn into blind black cats walking the field. This revision allowed Eli to feel that he had reached a new height. 

It’s just that Eli sometimes forgets to eat the strawberry.
