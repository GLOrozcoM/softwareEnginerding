Levantine: I ran out of my Felix’s ages ago ‘Tor. Besides, it is a viable question, who was worse? Engage me. 
Argentina: Well. Levantine is nice. His calling you is nice. It』s all so damn nice, Functor.   
Functor: Old line. 
Functor: I see what you mean. 
	Untrustworthy ant things start troooping towards me out of the marble sink. 「Bad math」, I would call this (or the opposite of Lithium Flower』s theme). Although each regales difference, they march to a single tempo. 
Functor: Dibs on Chaplin.
Functor: Who are you? 

- Humble brags (these troop as an entente with two too many trumpets)

- The desire for green eyes. 
- These performances people put on that are bad because they are either fake (in which case, they』re untrustworthy by essence) or they are not fake (but oh they feel fake) in which case they are untrustworthy by virtue of stupidity. 
Functor: I’m already getting married. 


If I eat it, it won』t die since its broken down vectors will still look for directions in my stomach. Whirlpools of lice growing in there.  
[One wonders how Levantine manages to speak without the umlauts.]
So I stare into it looking for the corpus of truth -
Functor: What is your name? 
Antennae waiting and brushing my shoulder -
humming Iko Iko while Feistel lounges on the couch thinking.]
