Integrability 

Freaking integrals light my fires, man. 

“Would you recognize an integrable function if it walked in the
door right now?” Mah brofessor said. 

We all swiveled at that moment to see it walking in. It didn’t 
(obviously, I mean what were you even thinking, of course 
that shit don’t happen).

“Now try saying it over and over again: integrable, integrable, 
integrable, integrable.” Mah brofessor spake. 

The word garbled my tongue into a nice Morpheus knot. 
Like Champagne for the mouth, warm. My integrals 
and me are tight yo. 

Negro 

Is negro truly egregiously ghastly as a word? 
Not-even, to think that in Spanish that is just a color.  
Gatsby is one to counter that thought with something like, “But
it has such divine phonetics: knee-grow”. 

Rupert 

Roo-perto himself, 
swings to himself, 
swags to himself, 
composes the anthem to himself, 
noting that a walk in the woods is 
smashing because there is no way to read the thoughts as they
leave faster than the mind can keep up with the type written words
whoa there is another one 
		trying to catch up 
	whoa 
but its now back here, and oo we need to speed up, 
back to Rupert, 
here he is, red hair and all red herring and all 
Rupert walks in the garden planting the water lily thoughts hoping they stir gently like the Blackbird
tones in Beatle songs understanding that all of it is only a Matrix. 
Unreal, computer simulated, untrue. 

*Pause*

Understanding which not falling not anchoring not doing anything! Zilch, 
zippo, zeeeero. 

Since for Rupert, simulations have always been good fun.
