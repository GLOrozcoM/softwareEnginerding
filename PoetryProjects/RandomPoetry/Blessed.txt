Blessed

Blessed is the Sabbath. For in it, my soul found no rest. 

Blessed is the lack of rest. For in it, I wondered if beauty
could really be that blonde. 

Blessed is beauty questioning. For in it, the waters 
felt fresh. 

Blessed are the fresh. For in it, my fraternity brothers
can tell me lovingly to fuck off. 


Blessed is the glorious expletive. For in it, my little
persona establishes an inner dialogue to exclude others. 

Blessed are my exclusions. For in them, the circle of 
my importance is made clearer. 

Blessed is my pride. For in it, my spit tastes the goodness
thereof.   

Blessed is my spit. For in it, death is still 
only a mirage. 

Blessed is the mirage. For in it, lie leeches suck 
my legs. 

Blessed are the leeches. For in them, blood finds 
true repose. 

Blessed are the restful. For in them, the Sabbath finds
its purpose. 

Blessed is the extra. For in it, the unseen future 
was given eyes. 

Blessed is the end. For in it, the beginning found 
its Sabbath.
