Word Box 

Comments: 

I originally titled this Word Box to myself (thus Word Box above Comments). Indeed, I could not see how this was the sum of its parts so I broke it down. Since these all came from the same original stream of consciousness, I felt tempted to place them in a suite. I said BAH to that since each does its gig by itself. I, however, place them all on this one page since they are a revision to the original stream.  

Sol

My favorite part was the last line in the original poem (Aztecs would quench…). That turned into a poem about ritual. The original line flowed from thinking about my life as a young male in that Mexican land so I thought LETS TRY MORE OF THAT. 

New Data

I suspect that what may seem weak in the poem is the data component and the earlier part concerning the pruning. But BAH I say, it works because data scientists prune the data all the time trying to find in there something NEW. 

Umibe No Kafka’s Destiny 

A lot is in the title (Murakami Haruki’s Kafka on the Shore). It’s the first time I’ve modified only the title to feel like it fits. 

Shells 

It needed to be alone.
