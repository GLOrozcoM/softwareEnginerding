To forget those harmonics, Eli remembers the lady walking the purple
dog with her arms at right angles, and how utterly splendid the whole
scene looked. Just like that time when the chicken had to duck because
the owl mistook the chicken』s head for a mouse. Or when the functions
yawned at him promising him their outputs. Or when he fell up to
pick that strawberry, caught between crocodiles and a Mongolian army.
The strawberry always tasted good to Eli.
