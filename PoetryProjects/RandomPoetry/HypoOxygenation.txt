Strong hand keeping my breathing components inside water. 
Flapping dead fish that I am whimpers. I wanted the Nubian’s lack of hesitation. 
Paying the price now for it. In between hypo and hyper oxygenation, I break lakeless end ->   

hypo - 

	Remember:  
	
		   - the numbness in your nose and mouth when the fat one 
           		one threw the red leather at your face and you smelled 
	     		asphalt-dirt-mengambrea while the puddles in your mind 
	     		screamed 
         	  	  - how that 68% in your first year smoked your capillaries, 
           		and the 51/60  only a few days ago, and honor』s countenance 
           		shone upon  thy friends, but upon you:  

								     - silence from　
							             砂漠の神々

	Forget: 

	    	    - the A* that Newport and Dartmouth forged and you did 
			find in art』s maw 
          	    	    - the 丸　and バツ on the pink slip you carry in your wallet now 
          	   	    - your named frequencies are read and they do not stop cheering 
          	    	    - that moment when you began to see like Asher, the discrete 
                            meanings in smooth forms: 

							- 質問は何より』s warm embrace 
							- assymetry 	


hyper - 

	Flow: 
		 - slow motion runs where the smiles』contour me 
		 - 「I find the beauty beastly」 
                       - Realising that reading people should not be a phrase you utter
		 
      Gravity: 
		  - Sense of smell 
                        - Sounds of sense 

	And so the drops rush downward inversely my face rises my fangs curl, and I see that no strong hand exists anymore. 笑えばいいんじゃなええか？
