Filter for the Righteous 

Comments: 

I intended the title to be a play on the idea that the poem filters for the righteous (i.e. only the righteous find the acrostic), and a double play on the fact that this is an arbitrary measure for something so glorious as righteousness. I am dropping it entirely. 

However, I took to mind your suggestion to use the acrostic as a generative device. So, I started by taking the “Filter for the righteous” and seeing what would come of it as an acrostic. “Freaking integral light” is as far as I got, and then I rushed to hug the integrals. I similarly, tried out different parts of “Filter for the righteous” to produce the other parts of these poems. 

They are ridiculous. (Salamun-esque?) I see them as cousins to the Good Morning set of poems even if they were generated in different manners.
