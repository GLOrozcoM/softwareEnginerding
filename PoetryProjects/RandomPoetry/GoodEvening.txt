Good Evening! 

Good evening, Mike! 
Good evening, Hope! 

Oh what a time to be alive!

Good evening, oh quad, now of Malesardi nomenclature! 
Good evening, lights of mourning! 

Oh what vivid vivacious vociferous venal virtue
oh Venice it is!

Urgh. WHERE ARE MY SOCKS? Ah. Found them. 

Oh what a grand time indeed! 

Wait. Why does it smell like red?
