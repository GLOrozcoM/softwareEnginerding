Forgiveness please -  a way to make amends for easy ignorance, stunted ambition. 

In the shadow of his perfect proportions, I crawl into a crevice. 

Not willingly. As under the Imperio of another, my arms curl into 
a re-enactment of my fetal origins. 

Too electric for the blue, too singed for the eye. 

But at least I have good posture. And my clothes fit me today.
