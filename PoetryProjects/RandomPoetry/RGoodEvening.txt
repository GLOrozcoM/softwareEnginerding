Trash 

How are you?! 

I am ecstatic to hear it! Absolutely enthralled to know it! 

No! Please! Let me ask again! 

How are you?! 

Excellent! By the way, mother wants the trash taken out.

[Laughs like Gabriel G. Marquez would want him to]

Politely 

Everard politely opens the door for women. 

He stands up on the metro to let women sit down. 

He sits down in a small hove of quietness to hear women speak. 

So, it follows that Everard politely shuts the ice fridge on them 
while they beat the door with their hands. 

In and out, up and down 

A set table blinks back as you work your way through:

The outer (salad) to the inner (meat) fork. 

The upper (butter) to the downer (dessert) knives. 

That all becomes irrelevant when the drunk Portuguese 
from Computer Science drops grease on your pants 
so try to wreck him please, thank you. 

Quintet

to do balletic movements for three and a half minutes?

What do you call it when you take 5 credits during a 
senior semester?

What do you call all of this? 

- Show-not-tell.
