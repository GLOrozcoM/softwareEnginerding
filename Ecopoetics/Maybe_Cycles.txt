The shadow of my pen moves the leaves of the trees. My cell phone flashlight does that. 

Do you know how many trees give up their cellulose for you?

There is no emotion, said Obi, there is peace.

A blank page tried to eat me once. It had big white teeth like a great white shark, and it smelled my blood. It’s eyes were like two ships, and it a carried a (n, k) number of maybes. 

Maybe	Maybe	Maybe	Maybe.

The cycles for maybe
(m -> a -> y -> b -> e)

The inverse
(e b y a m)

The machine in whole:

(a b y m)
 b y a a

But you see maybe is so much more. 
We wish it to wed Yes and divorce No. We sometimes love Maybe more than Is. It is too now. Too much hereness to be digestible.

I feel cold. Like a bullet at my heart. It would warm inside my chest. Only the bullet part would be freezing. 


Last time I was here, I remembered G.C.’s story about a bear in Lewisburg. I though on people running around like headless chickens. I looked up and

		the bear was there. 

It was looking at me from the bottom of the little hill. I was sure it was an illusion, but one can’t be sure (two, maybe). I looked at it a while longer then
decided to move to a bench. Lying on gravel is uncomfortable man (or woman? or something else?). So I walked towards the bear, but it didn’t move. 
I got closer and before my very eyes the bear

	turned into a pile of tires.
